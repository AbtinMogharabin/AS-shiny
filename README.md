# R-shiny-app-project

In this project, I designed a Shiny app on the Asylum data. The app provides a variety of advanced statistical methods such as:
- data analysis methods (e.g. machine learning models, linear models, tools for checking the assumptions of each model, specific summary tables for the results of each model, and many more)
- data visualization tools (e.g. facet, violin plots, scatter plots, plots of machine learning models, log plots, box plots, etc. Along with many options to customize each plot such as the variables, range of values, themes, colors, etc.)
- advanced options to filter and view the dataset
- an interactive map that allows users to view and explore the data of each country
- and many more!

At the moment, the app could mainly be used by running the AS-Shiny.R file directly from your device. I also configured the app on the shinyapp server. Unfortunately, the server is too weak to handle a complex app like this one (after all, R was designed for convenient data analysis, not for designing complex web apps such as this one). But if you're curious, you could open the app from [here](https://amogharab.shinyapps.io/AS-Shiny/) (Try refreshing the page multiple times. In some rare occasions the app shows up properly). I will design a custom architecture and fix this problem later.
